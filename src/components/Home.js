      <h1>Beyoncé</h1>
      <p>
        One of the most recognizable figures in contemporary music, Beyoncé rose
        to fame as the central member of pop-R&B group Destiny's Child before
        embarking on a multi-platinum, record-breaking solo career in 2001.
        Booming record sales, Grammy awards, movie roles, and marriage to
        rapper/CEO Jay-Z combined to heighten her profile in the 2000s.
        Billboard named her female artist of the decade, while the RIAA
        acknowledged that, through 64 gold and platinum certifications, she was
        the decade's top-selling artist. Once she released her fifth solo album
        in 2013, it was evident that the singer, songwriter, and dancer wasn't
        merely an entertainer but a progressive artist as well.
